# ASSIST (Alcoholism Solutions: Synthesizing Information to Support Treatments)

This project contains the source code of ASSIST analysis modules developed under the Phase I of the ASSIST project. These modules can be run in Jupyter notebooks, Docker containers, as well as workflows managed by the ADE (Active Discovery Engine) with increasing support for provenance.

### Description of analysis modules:
| Analysis Module | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Network Analysis | <brief description> |
| Module Extraction | <brief description> |
| Module Membership Analysis | <brief description> |
| Module DE/Diagnostic Correlation | <brief description> |
| Module Network Embedding |<brief description> |
| ML and Critical Gene Identifier | <brief description> |


## User Guide
Below we describe how to set up and run the ASSIST analysis modules in the three different modes.

### How to set up the environment for Jupyter notebooks
Jupyter notebooks for ASSIST analysis modules are included to allow researchers to test out the analysis code using the Jupyter notebook interface.
